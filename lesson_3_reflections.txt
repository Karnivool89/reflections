Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A: When you want to collaborate or immediately share your work.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A: If you are collaborating, you may not want to pull an updated file unknowingly because it may interfere if you are already working on that file.
