Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A: When you initialize a repository, it creates a new git repository in the current directory. You need this to begin keeping track of changes to your project.

Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

A: The staging area is different from the WD and the repo because it sits in between them, as a temporary measure. The staging area is valuable because it allows you to plan out which files will be committed.

Q: How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

A: If you use the command "git diff" with no argument, it will show you the differences between your working directory and the staging area. Inspecting this difference will allow you to review if there is more than one logical change happening in the current commit.

Q: What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

A: Branches would be helpful when you want to work on a different version of your code that could be considered separate from your main version.

Q: How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

A: By providing a visual depiction of the branches(?).
